# Fruit Recognition System

This repository contains the code for a Fruit Recognition System. The system is designed to identify various types of fruits using image classification techniques. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, and Express.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: The system uses machine learning algorithms to classify images of fruits into different categories.
- **Web Interface**: The system comes with a web-based interface built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and EJS templates for easy interaction.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Pre-trained models are included for easy setup and usage.
- **Customizable**: The codebase is highly customizable, allowing users to fine-tune models or train their own from scratch.

## Usage

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/BaraSedih11/FruitRecognitionSystem.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd FruitRecognitionSystem
```
3. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

### Running the System

1. Start the server:
```
node app.js
```
2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to classify images using the web interface.

## Dataset

The system is trained on a dataset containing images of various fruits. The dataset used can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CX9-T6da9g1IIgfYGRbRURjkD9pLzPCd/view?usp=sharing).
