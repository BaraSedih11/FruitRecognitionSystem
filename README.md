# Fruit Recognition System

This repository contains the code for a Fruit Recognition System. The system is designed to identify various types of fruits using image classification techniques. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, and Express.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: The system uses machine learning algorithms to classify images of fruits into different categories.
- **Web Interface**: The system comes with a web-based interface built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and EJS templates for easy interaction.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Pre-trained models are included for easy setup and usage.
- **Customizable**: The codebase is highly customizable, allowing users to fine-tune models or train their own from scratch.
